Endpoint sniffer, take in a list of words and then make requests and notify if the request was successful against the given `subdomain` and or 
`endpoint`. 


## Installation 

Even whilst it is still WIP, if you wish to install it, run the below commands to move it into your `bin`, this assumes that you have downloaded the binary into you `Downloads` folder: 

```bash
  cd ~/Downloads 
  chmod +x dizzy 
  mv ./dizzy /usr/local/bin/
```

Once this is done, you should be able to use the `dizzy` command, in your terminal.
